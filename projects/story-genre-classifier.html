                How much do you know about fan made stories? Did you know about the immense world of fan community where non-professional and semi-professional writers alike showcase their writing ability. Well, I found out about it and thought, why not utilize these data to make a NLP classification model that can learn pattern from fan made stories.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project showcases the implementation of multi-label text classification using Hugging Face Transformers and Fastai. It involves training a deep learning model to predict multiple genre labels for text descriptions. Key features include web scraping with Selenium Webdriver, data extraction from Royal Road (a fan-made stories website), utilization of pre-trained transformer models, Fastai's text processing capabilities, performance analysis metrics like F1 score and ROC AUC, and detailed code explanations.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Web Scraping with Selenium Webdriver:</strong>
                        <p>Leveraging the power of Selenium Webdriver, we embarked on a web scraping journey to extract valuable information from Royal Road. Our focus was on gathering story summaries and their corresponding genres, crucial elements for training a multi-label text classification model.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Cover Images Data:</strong>
                        <p>In addition to the story summaries and genres, we extracted a special kind of data unrelated to the trained model: cover images. During the scraping process, we also opened the cover image for each story. Using real-time K-means clustering techniques, we isolated the 5 dominant color codes for each cover image, adding a unique visual dimension to our dataset.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong>
                        <p>Throughout the data collection process, we maintained a commitment to ethical practices, respecting the terms of use of the Royal Road website and ensuring responsible scraping.</p>

                <p>
                    Our endeavor to explore the cool world of fan-made stories on Royal Road resulted in the creation of a robust dataset. Each story summary, intertwined with its associated genres, and complemented by unique cover image color data, became a comprehensive foundation for our project on multi-label text classification. This dataset, cultivated from the diverse narratives of Royal Road, forms the basis for training a deep learning model capable of predicting multiple genre labels for a given text description.

                <h3>Leveraging Pre-trained Transformer Models</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, we harnessed the power of pre-trained transformer models from Hugging Face Transformers to elevate our text classification capabilities. By tapping into these models, we gained access to their extensive knowledge of language and context, allowing us to achieve impressive results in genre classification.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Choice: bert-base-uncased Architecture</h3>
                <p>
                    For this project, we selected the bert-base-uncased architecture, a well-established variant of BERT that's specifically designed for uncased text. By making this strategic choice, we enabled our model to comprehend the subtleties of language usage, leading to enhanced accuracy and performance in genre classification.
